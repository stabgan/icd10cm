{"code": "A001", "description": "Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar eltor", "detailed_context": "### 1. Disease Overview\n\n*   **Definition and Epidemiology:** Cholera, caused by *Vibrio cholerae* O1 biovar El Tor, is an acute diarrheal illness characterized by profuse watery stools, vomiting, and rapid dehydration. It can lead to hypovolemic shock and acidosis. The El Tor biotype is one of the two main biotypes of *Vibrio cholerae* O1, the other being the Classical biotype. The El Tor biotype can cause a milder form of cholera compared to the Classical biotype. However, it has a higher infectious dose and can survive longer in the environment, which has contributed to its widespread distribution and persistence in many parts of the world. Cholera remains a significant public health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water."}
